## Project Feature Hightlight
In this project, we will develop intelligent agents with autonomous planning capabilities, and a series of tools and MCP services.

Requirement as follows:
- AI agents: can reason and act autonomously according to user needs until the goal is achieved.
- Tools provided to AI: including network search, file operations, web crawling, resource downloads, terminal operations, and PDF generation.
- AI MCP Service: search for images from specific websites.

## Technology
The project focuses on the practical application of the Spring AI development framework and involves the use of various mainstream AI clients and tool libraries.
- Java 21 + Spring Boot 3
- Spring AI + LangChain4j
- RAG knowledge
- PGvector embedding database
- Tool calling
- MCP model context protocol
- ReAct Agent
- Serverless
- LLM platform
- Server-Sent Events
- Third party API: SearchAPI / Pexels API
- Tool libraries such as: Kryo high-performance serialization + Jsoup web crawling + iText PDF generation + Knife4j interface documentation
